## Introduction

So, you want to create your own instruments or module in VCV Rack, Welcome on board !
Before we start talking about computer programming, let´s have a look at the general profile and basic knowledge you may need during the process of creating your plugin. right now, you have an idea, and i´am sure, the best one ! As a musician, you may have been diving into some sort of code... or not ! 

Basically, musicians don´t like to loose their time into coding work, but there are exceptions of course.
In this case, you want to join the group of musician-developper, and that´s fine. We will progress step by step and go from a basic module to very complexe ones.
