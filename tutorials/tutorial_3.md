# Using moduleÂ´s Template files

As we have a basic understanding of how we will make a new module plugin from a bunch of files, placed in the Correct folder ! 
[**HERE**](files/tutorial_VCV_modules.zip) is the link to download the template files ! Get the archive and uncompress it in your plugins folder... you should be able to access this directory:
```
C:/msys64/home/Rack/plugins/tutorial/
```

Now, lets have a look in detail inside those files. At least, you need only 4 files to make a module:
* _**Makefile**_ = Got all relation data para building the final plugin
* _**MyModule.cpp**_ = Got all the source code of your module
* _**MyProject.cpp**_ = Got all initialization data, shared between modules (if you create more than one)
* _**MyProject.hpp**_ = Gor all Project references, common data and shared UI elements

## Makefile
```
# If RACK_DIR is not defined when calling the Makefile, default to two directories above
RACK_DIR ?= ../..
